Generators
----------


Velocity field generators prescribe the flow conditions for your problem. For instance, you can have an aircraft at
a prescribed fixed location in a velocity field towards the aircraft. Alternatively, you can have a free moving
aircraft in a static velocity field.

Dynamic Control Surface generators enable the user to prescribe a certain control surface deflection in time.
