The controller receives sensor measurements from SHARPy using an interface based on the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). After generating the control input, the control interface feeds this input back to the actuators incorporated in SHARPy again through the UDP interface.  \n",

    "Next, we need to define our network settings. Therefore, we need to define the IP addresses for the server (SHARPy) and client (on whatever machine you run your computer), and the ports used. Another important input is the `variables_filename` in which we define the in and output parameters. Have a look in the file and make sure to change the position of your output node in case you make the beam discretisation finer. As we only need to measure the vertical tip displacement for our controller to work, we only have one sensor. We just save this parameter here as it is important later for the client to know, how much data it should receive from SHARPy."
